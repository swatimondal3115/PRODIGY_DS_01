## Exploratory data analysis on country population

### Population Demographics Visualization:
This repository contains scripts and tools for visualizing the distribution of demographic variables such as age, gender, income, etc., using bar charts and histograms. Visualizing demographic data is crucial for understanding population characteristics and making data-driven decisions in various fields including marketing, public policy, and social sciences.

#### Features:
1.Bar Charts: Provides functionality to create bar charts for visualizing the distribution of categorical variables like gender.

2.Histograms: Includes tools for generating histograms to show the distribution of continuous variables such as age or income.

3.Customization: Allows customization of chart aesthetics, labels, and styles to suit different visualization needs.

4.Interactive Visualizations: Option to create interactive charts using libraries like Plotly for enhanced exploration of demographic distributions

##### Generating Visualizations:
Prepare your demographic data in a suitable format (CSV, Excel, etc.).

Use the provided scripts (plot_age_distribution.py, plot_gender_distribution.py, etc.) to generate bar charts or histograms.
